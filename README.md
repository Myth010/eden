eden
====
Eden is a Mudlet + Lua system for the online game Imperian. It was designed with the philosophy of intuitive mudding and targeted to the new MUD player.

Features:
  * Basic affliction tracker
  * Basic limb tracker
  * Automatic check for updates
  * Multi-character support on a single profile

Once set up, you should be able to design your own offensive system with bare-bones coding, leaving all the finicky tracking to the underlying system.

Currently, Eden supports these classes:
  * Assassin
  * Diabolist
  * Summoner
