191 - The question for each man to settle is not what he would do if he had the means, time, influence and educational advantages; the question is what he will do with the things he has. The moment a young man ceases to dream or to bemoan his lack of opportunities and resolutely looks his conditions in the face, and resolves to change them, he lays the corner-stone of a solid and honourable success.
192 - The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up.

270 - Experience is not what happens to a man: it is what a man does with what happens to him.

340 - Competence starts with guaranteeing your work.
341 - Incalculable effort and hardship over countless generations evolved into the life, values and happiness we take for granted today. Every day should be a celebration of existence.
